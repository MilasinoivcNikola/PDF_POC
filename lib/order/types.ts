// The shared commerce contract: an `Order` is one paid (or pending) book purchase
// that moves through a fulfillment state machine (lib/order/state.ts), is persisted
// in Supabase Postgres (lib/order/store.ts), and references a photo + final PDF in
// Supabase Storage (lib/supabase/storage.ts). Every later commerce PR (catalog,
// storefront, intake, checkout, worker, admin, delivery) imports this.
//
// `OrderStatus` is a string-literal union — not a loose `string` — so the state
// machine and the worker get exhaustive `switch` safety, matching the
// `Species`/`SessionStatus` union style in lib/session/types.ts.

 *
 *   pending_payment → paid → queued → generating → awaiting_review → approved → delivered
 *
 * plus the off-happy-path states:
 *   - `failed`    — generation or review failed; needs operator attention.
 *   - `refunded`  — money returned (terminal).
 *   - `cancelled` — order abandoned/voided before delivery (terminal).
 *
 * Legal moves between these live in ONE place — `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` in
 * lib/order/state.ts — never re-encoded ad hoc by a caller.

 * translation — the same shape the local wizard already produces and
 * `resolveStory*` already reads.
 *
 * Storage keys (`photoKey`, `pdfKey`) are object paths inside the private
 * Supabase buckets, not URLs — delivery mints a short-lived signed URL on demand
 * (lib/supabase/storage.ts `signedPdfUrl`).
 *
 * Field naming is camelCase here; the Postgres columns are snake_case. The
 * mapping lives in ONE place — `rowToOrder` / `orderToRow` in lib/order/store.ts.
