# Project History

A running log of completed features, in order. **Tiered (feature 27):** this file is
the lean index — one line per entry. The full multi-paragraph write-up for each entry
lives verbatim in [`context/history/`](./history/) (`YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`) and is loaded
on demand via the `→` link. **Adding an entry** (`/feature complete`): write the full
write-up to a new file under `context/history/`, then append one index line here under
the right milestone. Durable deferrals from the work go in [`context/debt.md`](./debt.md),
not buried in the write-up.
