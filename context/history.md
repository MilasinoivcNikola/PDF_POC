# Project History

A running log of completed features, in order. **Tiered (feature 27):** this file is
the lean index — one line per entry. The full multi-paragraph write-up for each entry
lives verbatim in [`context/history/`](./history/) (`YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`) and is loaded
on demand via the `→` link. **Adding an entry** (`/feature complete`): write the full
write-up to a new file under `context/history/`, then append one index line here under
the right milestone. Durable deferrals from the work go in [`context/debt.md`](./debt.md),
not buried in the write-up.

Cost floor = climax at Medium. → proceed to PR-A (Feature 31) → [archive](history/2026-06-14-story-8-pr-0-approach-b-illustration-prototype-gate.md)

- 2026-06-15 — Rename the brand to Dearbound — `feature/rename-dearbound` (f1fd117, merge 1eaf042) — branding string rename only ("Quietly Kept" → **Dearbound**, dearbound.com): new `lib/brand.ts` `BRAND` single-source across ~16 pages + `<title>` suffixes, new tagline ("custom illustrated books starring your pet"), softened catalog/nav label ("The keepsakes" → "The books"), email/PDF-fallback/live-docs/masterstories rebranded; "keepsake" kept as a product descriptor (D2), history + superseded specs left as the dated record (D3, prior brand Quietly Kept); guard test fails on any surviving "Quietly Kept" (mutation-verified).

## Milestone 15 — Public-pages refresh

- 2026-06-15 — Public Refresh PR-1: Catalog Data Foundation — `feature/public-refresh-catalog-data` — data + pure helpers only, zero visible change: added `audience: "living" | "loss"` + optional `displayTitle?` to the `Product` contract, classified all 8 titles (5 living / 3 loss — the deliberate Story-6 "While You're Still Here" → living reclassification, partition-test-pinned), added `getProductsByAudience` / `productDisplayTitle` selectors; module stays pure/client-safe; new-book-playbook updated for the now-required `audience` field — unblocks PR-2/3/4 → [archive](history/2026-06-15-public-refresh-pr-1-catalog-data-foundation.md)
- 2026-06-15 — Public Refresh PR-2: Shared Chrome + Landing — `feature/public-refresh-chrome-landing` — extracted client-safe `components/site/SiteHeader`/`SiteFooter` (nav cluster + 3-column `footer-rich`) and swapped **all** public pages onto them (bodies unchanged); rewrote the landing into hero → two-worlds (gold living / rose loss) → how-it-works, all counts catalog-derived (kills "Six keepsakes"); new `TAGLINE` constant; deleted the old chooser/TOC + `page.module.css`; order page keeps its own checkout header (deliberate) → [archive](history/2026-06-15-public-refresh-pr-2-shared-chrome-and-landing.md)
- 2026-06-15 — Public Refresh PR-3: Catalog (`/books`) — `feature/public-refresh-catalog-page` — split the single 8-title grid into two anchored sections (`#living` "To celebrate them" gold / `#loss` "To remember them" rose), driven by PR-1's `getProductsByAudience` (5 living first / 3 loss), derived count chips; richer cards (kicker + `productDisplayTitle` + price + count); count line derived from `illustrationCount` ("N illustrations") except the page-framed Story 1 ("12 pages"), via a page-local `CARD_COPY` lookup (kept out of pure `products.ts`); placeholder paw art for the sample-less Story 8/9 + emptied their dead `sampleImages` paths (404 fix, tests relaxed to `[]`); stays `○` Static, boundary unchanged; new-book-playbook gained a "samples optional/backfillable" note → [archive](history/2026-06-15-public-refresh-pr-3-catalog-page.md)
- 2026-06-15 — Public Refresh PR-4: Book Detail + Policies + Download — `feature/public-refresh-detail-pages` — final PR of the refresh, presentation only: rebuilt the three remaining page bodies. Detail page gets `productDisplayTitle` titles, audience tint (gold living / rose loss on eyebrow+tagline), the PR-3 placeholder-paw gallery fallback for sample-less Story 8/9, and the explicit Story 2 ↔ 5 `companionId` callout (both directions verified, link text → `productDisplayTitle`); policies gained `#how-its-made`/`#refunds-and-remakes`/`#privacy` anchors (terms verbatim) with the shared SiteFooter now pointing at them; download untouched (PR-2 already refreshed it). Tiers held (`●` SSG detail / `○` Static policies / `ƒ` Dynamic download), boundary test unchanged; per-book "inside the book" TOC deferred to `debt.md`; QA 6/6 — **completes Milestone 15** → [archive](history/2026-06-15-public-refresh-pr-4-detail-policies-download.md)

## Dev-process & tooling

- 2026-06-13 — Feature 27: Lean the Context System — `feature/lean-context-system` (8acefc3, merge 8ce2183) — docs-only, zero-loss: tiered the history into a lean index + `context/history/` archive (39 files, byte-identical), trimmed `CLAUDE.md` `@`-loads to 5 live docs, pointed test-restating prose at its tests, added the `context/debt.md` ledger → [archive](history/2026-06-13-lean-context-system.md)
